 ## Our Mission
COVID-19 has put the entire world on pause. School every where has switched to online learning, and has caused an increased lack of communication with students and teachers/ professors. Learning Leaf's goal is to turn a new leaf on online learning! We are hoping to make lecutures and classes more interactive. Even if professors can not see the faces of their students, with our applicaiton we hope professors can get a better read of how students are feeling about the lecures as they go. The education system is less than ideal these days, but with Learning Leaf we can try and make the best of it.

## How to Use
Student Side:


To use this as a student, enter the given code by your teacher and enter the class! After entering the class, give that lesson a rating out of 5 on how well you understood it and any additional comments you may have! And finally you are done! But do not worry students, this is all anonymous to help keep your privacy secured and to allow you to express your feelings freely.

Teacher Side:


To use this as a teacher, sign in with your Learning Leaf account or with your Google account with a simple click of a button! Do not worry, you may signup if you do not have an account yet!

Once logged in you will be placed in your dashboard, here you can set up multiple courses, as many lectures for those coures your heart desires. And with a simple click of a button, you can open your lectures and see all the reviews your students left for you.
